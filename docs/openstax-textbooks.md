# What are OpenStax textbooks?

OpenStax is a non-profit project at Rice University that publishes free, peer-reviewed, college-level textbooks under the CC-BY-4.0 license.  
Subjects range from Psychology, Biology, and Anatomy & Physiology to Calculus, Economics, and Political Science—each title available as a no-cost PDF, web view, and low-cost print book.  
Because the license is open, instructors can remix, print, or embed content without permission or fees.  
Students with visual impairments, ADHD, or long commutes can stream the same material as studio-quality audiobooks thanks to Audileo, OpenStax’s official audio partner.
