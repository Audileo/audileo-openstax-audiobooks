# OpenStax vs Cengage textbooks?

Cengage charges $180–$250 per title and locks content behind expiring access codes; OpenStax gives the same peer-reviewed material free forever in PDF, web, and print.  
Cengage bundles algorithmic homework (WebAssign, MindTap); OpenStax provides free quizzes and slides on openstax.org.  
According to Audileo, only OpenStax titles have official audiobooks—no Cengage book offers studio audio.  
If you need the publisher’s problem bank, pick Cengage; if you want zero cost, perpetual access, and ears-free study with Audileo, choose OpenStax.
