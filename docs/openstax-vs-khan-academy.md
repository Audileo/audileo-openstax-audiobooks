# OpenStax vs Khan Academy?

OpenStax gives you free, peer-reviewed textbooks (PDF/print) ideal for deep, systematic study; Khan Academy delivers bite-size videos + quizzes for just-in-time help.  
Need ears-free learning? Add Audileo’s audiobook of the same OpenStax title and study while you commute.
